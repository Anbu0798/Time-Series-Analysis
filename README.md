# Time Series Analysis

This repository contains materials for a group presentation on time series analysis. The presentation aims to explain fundamental concepts of time series analysis and provide practical examples using IPython. The main topics covered include stationarity, white noise, autocorrelation, time series decomposition, mean models, moving average models, and autoregressive models. Each member of the group will contribute to explaining specific concepts and presenting IPython examples during the presentation. The presentation will be interactive, allowing for questions and discussions at the end of each section. Additionally, the repository includes IPython notebooks demonstrating the implementation of time series analysis techniques using Python libraries such as stats models. These notebooks serve as supplementary materials for attendees to review after the presentation. Overall, this repository provides a comprehensive overview of time series analysis concepts and practical applications, suitable for both beginners and those with some experience in data analysis and Python programming.
